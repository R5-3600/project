# Projects & ideas.

Future plans:

I plan to get Android 10 GSI Project Treble to install and boot fine on the Samsung Galaxy Tab A 8.0" wifi 2019 (SM-T290) (gtowifi).


Plans that are already in progress:

None at this time.


Finished projects for the SM-T290:

1) TWRP (tested, works)
2) A custom ROM (tested, works)
