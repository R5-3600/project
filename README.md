# Projects & ideas.

Future plans:

I plan to get TWRP built and running correctly on the Samsung Galaxy Tab A 8.0" wifi 2019 (SM-T290) (gtowifi). So that we can start getting a LineageOS development started on the device. As well, get Phh-Treble GSI's installed, and booted on the device.


Plans that are already in progress:

I plan to make a Android 9 Pie ROM for the SM-T290 model which is based on the stock Samsung OneUI Core 1.1 firmware, and release it very soon for testing.


Finished projects for the SM-T290:

1) TWRP (currently in testing)
2) A custom ROM (currently in testing)
